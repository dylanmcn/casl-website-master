		<h3>skNLA - Scikit Nonlinear Analysis</h3>
		<p><span class="image left"><img src="{{site.url}}images/tools/lorenz.png" alt="" /></span> <a href="https://github.com/NickC1/skNLF">Github</a> </p>

			This package is an implementation of nonlinear forecasting (NLF) using scikit-learn's style. It reconstructs phase spaces to analyze behavior and make forecasts. The technique is described in depth in Nonlinear Time Series Analysis by Kantz and Schreiber. skNLF looks for past configurations of the system that are similar to the present configuration of the system. It then looks at how the system evolved when it was in those similar configurations and uses that knowledge to make forecasts about future evolution. The forecasts are then compared to the actual evolution of the system.

			This package is an implementation of convergent cross mapping (CCM) using scikit-learn's style. More specifically it is an implementation from the paper, Detecting Causality in Complex Ecosystems. It reconstructs phase spaces to analyze the effects of one system on the other. For a quick explanation, refer to State Space Reconstruction: Convergent Cross Mapping by Sugihara Lab</p>

	<p>
		BuoyPy pulls data from the National Data Buoy Center, cleans it, and puts it into pandas dataframes.
