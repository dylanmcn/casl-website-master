		<h3>Beach Cam - <a href="http://video-monitoring.com/beachcams/uncw/"> Live View</a></h3>
		<p><span class="image left"><img src="{{site.url}}images/data/beachcam.png" alt="" /></span>
			CASL's has two robust beach cameras located at Wrightsville Beach, NC. The cameras started collecting images in June of 2014. The camera takes a time stacked image every fifteen minutes as well as a high resolution image. One of the cameras is pointed North and the other is pointed south. After the images have been collected, they are processed using classic computer vision techniques. Modern machine learning algorithms are applied to the image to classify which regions of the image are dune, beach, water, or foam. After this classification, the beach width is calculated and we are able to produce a time series of beach width through time.

	<h3>NC Buoy Data</h3>
	<p><span class="image left"><img src="{{site.url}}images/data/buoy.png" alt="" /></span>
		CASL uses NOAA's National Data Buoy Center for many research purposes. Having a clean data set available at any point in time is quite convenient. CASL currently archives the buoy's closest to our coast. </p>

	<h3>Narrabeen-Collaroy Beach Historical Survey Program</h3>

			"The monthly beach profile survey program at Narrabeen reached its 40-year milestone in April 2016. Online access to this dataset now facilitates its unrestricted use by the international coastal research community. It is envisaged that open access to these data may provide additional stimulus to coastal morphodynamic modellers to develop, test and (it is hoped) significantly advance the next generation of beach erosion-recovery hindcasting and forecasting tools. It is also hoped that this website can be a useful educational resource for students and teachers. As a discipline, our ability to predict anticipated coastal changes in the context of a changing climate is presently in its relative infancy. In the meantime, as the current custodians of this unique resource, it is the intention that collection of monthly profile data at Narrabeen will continue for the foreseeable future and be provided here, as our contribution to generations who follow.""
