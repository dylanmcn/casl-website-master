# CLASS ATTENDANCE

Attendance is required to do well in this course.  

# GRADING

Computational Modeling Projects*    =  80 pts   

Final Project                       =  20 pts

TOTAL POINTS AVAILABLE              =  100 pts

Final project presentations are to be 20 minutes long.  Ideas are due by week 10.

Grades will be given as follows:  
                  90%-100%                              A  
                  80%-89%                               B  
                  70%-79%                               C  
                  60%-69%                               D  
                  Below 60%                             F  


# COURSE OBJECTIVE

Upon completing this course, students will have developed the ability to apply numerical modeling tools associated with the study of complex systems to a wide range of problems in physics and the broader field of complexity.
