## SYLLABUS

**This is the new online syllabus due to the lost time as a result of Hurricane Florence.**

***This is a 3 credit course and as such, it requires 2250 minutes of instruction in a typical semester.  The UNC system has given UNCW a reprieve of 200 minutes for all classes due to the recent hurricane.  Therefore, PHY 321 is required to have 2050 instructional minutes for Fall 2018.***

***Before the storm we had met for five lectures totaling 375 minutes.  After the storm, and taking into account the time lost due to Tropical Storm Michael and the time lost for my travel on 10/16, we will have 15 lectures.  The university has added 5 minutes to these lectures so that they now comprise 80 minutes.  Therefore, we will have 1200 minutes of lecture post Florence.  We will also have 180 minutes of class time used during the final exam.  Taking the 2050 minutes required for Fall 2018 and subtracting 375, 1200, and 180 minutes leaves 295 minutes to be made up.***

***To make this time up, we will extend class by another 5 minutes for the remaining 15 lectures – this gives us another 75 minutes of lecture.   We will have two additional 50 minute lectures on 10/17 and 11/14 – this gives us another 100 minutes of lecture.  Finally, I will also add required viewing of 120 minutes worth of online lecture material that will be posted to my website.  Adding this 120 minutes to the 100 minutes of extra lectures and to the 75 minutes of extra lecture time, gives 295 minutes, which gets this course to the 2050 minutes needed for the Fall 2018 semester.***

# CLASS ATTENDANCE

Attendance is required to do well in this course.  

# FLIPPING

I am flipping the classroom for portions of the semester.  This means you will do problems in class and watch lectures at home.  Class lectures can be found here: https://vimeo.com/user31119044/videos and they are linked below.

# GRADING

2 Exams each worth 100 points       =  200 pts  
In class “quizzes” worth a total of =  100 pts  
Comprehensive Final worth           =  200 pts  
TOTAL POINTS AVAILABLE              =  500 pts

Grades will be given as follows*:  
                  90%-100%                              A  
                  80%-89%                               B  
                  70%-79%                               C  
                  60%-69%                               D  
                  Below 60%                             F  
                 
*Note – Under certain circumstances I reserve the right to lower this scale.


# COURSE OBJECTIVE

In this course you will learn the Newtonian, Lagrangian, and Hamiltonian formulations of mechanics.  We will cover the following topics: Newton’s Laws, momentum, energy, oscillations, chaotic dynamics, and rotating frames of reference.
